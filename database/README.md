# Database FAQ

This database is a collection of text files containing all funded Bitcoin addresses downloaded from http://addresses.loyce.club/

## How Many Addresses Does The Database Have?

The database currently holds `55,100,466 Bitcoin addresses`.

## Why Are There So Many Files?

There are multiple files because GitHub limits file uploads to 50 MB. The single file is too large, so it was split into multiple files each under 50 MB in order to be uploaded to GitHub.
